This repository contains the SLGF that is proposed to solve the highly constrained FJSP outlined in this paper:
...

it contains of the following 3 folders:

1 - datasets
The datasets used in the work, contains both literature datasets and customly generated for this specific FJSP. Also contains some helper functions for the datasets.

2 - heuristics
Simple heuristics/algorithms implemented for benchmarking purposes

3 - SLGF
The SLGF outlined in the paper. Also has the vanila EGA which is the base of the SLGF.
