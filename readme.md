This repository contains the SLEGA that is proposed to solve the highly constrained FJSP outlined in this paper:
...

it contains of the following 3 folders:

1 - datasets
The datasets used in the work, contains both literature datasets and customly generated for this specific FJSP. Also contains some helper functions for the datasets.

2 - heuristics
